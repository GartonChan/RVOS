	 * Setting baud rate. Just a demo here if we care about the divisor,

	 *
	 * Notice that the divisor register DLL (divisor latch least)
     * and DLM (divisor latch most) have the same base address
     * as the receiver/transmitter and the interrupt enable register.
     * 
     * To change what the base address points to, we open the "divisor latch"
     * by writing 1 into the Divisor Latch Access Bit(DLAB),
     * which is bit index 7 of the Line Control Register (LCR).
	 *
	 * Regarding the baud rate value, see [1] "BAUD RATE GENERATOR PROGRAMMING TABLE".
     * "Customize Baud Rates can be achieved by selecting proper 
     * divisor values for MSBand LSB of baud rate generator."
	 * According to the reference[1], we use 38.4K when 1.8432 MHZ crystal, so
     * the corresponding value is 3. And due to the divisor register is
     * two bytes (16 bits), so we need to split the value of 3 (0x0003)
     * into two bytes, DLL stores the low byte, DLM stores the high byte.
